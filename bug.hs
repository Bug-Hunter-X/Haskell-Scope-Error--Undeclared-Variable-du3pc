This Haskell code attempts to use a function that is not in scope. This often happens when a module is not imported or when the function's name is misspelled.  Another possibility is that the function is defined later in the file than where it is used, causing a compilation error because the compiler hasn't seen its definition yet.

```haskell
main = do
  let x = myFunc 5  -- myFunc is not in scope
  print x

```
