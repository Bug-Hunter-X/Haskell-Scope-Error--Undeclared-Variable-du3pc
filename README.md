This repository demonstrates a common Haskell error: using a variable or function that hasn't been properly declared or imported into scope. The `bug.hs` file contains the erroneous code, and the `bugSolution.hs` file provides the corrected version. The issue arises from either a missing import statement or a misspelling of a function's name. This example highlights the importance of careful attention to Haskell's scoping rules.
